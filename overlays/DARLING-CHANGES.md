# Darling changes to vendored upstream sources

`build.sh` fetches [apple/swift-foundation](https://github.com/apple/swift-foundation) at a pinned
commit (`dbacc67779dc0a41ddc9493acbaa332d76c9fb03`, tag `swift-6.3.3-RELEASE`) and compiles the files
its `UPSTREAM_FILES` and `UPSTREAM_INTL_FILES` lists name in place. Those are byte-identical to
upstream, so they are not vendored here. The swift-foundation files this overlay has to change are
not taken from the checkout; they live in `Foundation/` and each one's reason is below, measured
rather than assumed.
[apple/swift-collections](https://github.com/apple/swift-collections) is fetched the same way, at
`c11818f3cae0780656baa430b49e7f163f08dffd` (tag `1.1.6`), and nothing of it is vendored.

Set `SWIFT_FOUNDATION_SRC` or `SWIFT_COLLECTIONS_SRC` to an existing checkout of the matching commit
to build offline. Neither checkout is ever written to, so no patch is applied to a tree you supply.
To see exactly how one of the override files diverges, diff it against the checkout, for example
`diff -u "$src/Sources/FoundationEssentials/AttributedString/AttributedStringProtocol.swift" overlays/Foundation/AttributedStringProtocol.swift`.

Both projects are Apache License v2.0 with the Runtime Library Exception. Upstream file headers are
preserved in the files kept here, and swift-foundation's `LICENSE.md` and `NOTICE.txt` sit
beside them.

`Foundation/Locale+Language.swift` was vendored by the Locale work and is byte-identical to
`dbacc67`, so it moves into the fetch list here. `Foundation/Locale+Components.swift` stays, because
it diverges by 7 lines, and `Foundation/Locale+Darling.swift` stays because it is Darling-written
rather than upstream code. Both are documented below.

`Locale.Language`, `Locale.LanguageCode`, `Locale.Region` and `Locale.Currency` all live in
`FoundationEssentials`, which does not link ICU: they are value wrappers over a string identifier
plus static ISO code tables. Only the accessors that *reach* them from a `Locale` live in
`FoundationInternationalization`, and those are reimplemented over Darling's `NSLocale` instead
(below). The ICU-backed format styles are a different case and do use ICU, Darling's own; see
"ICU-backed format styles" below.
## Darling-specific adaptations

The other files in `Foundation/` come from the Swift 5.4 Darwin overlay and predate this mechanism;
`README.md` describes them.

## Which files are swift-foundation's, and how to check

Which files count as swift-foundation's is a provenance claim, and provenance cannot be settled by diffing against
swift-foundation alone: this overlay's other lineage is the Swift 5.4 Darwin overlay, and both
descend from the same original code, so a file being close to swift-foundation proves nothing.
Diffing against **both** lineages does settle it. Against
`release-5.4/stdlib/public/Darwin/Foundation` and `swift-foundation/Sources/FoundationEssentials`,
counting changed lines:

- `Pointers+DataProtocol.swift`, `Collections+DataProtocol.swift`, `ContiguousBytes.swift` and
  `DataProtocol.swift` are **byte-identical to the 5.4 overlay** while differing from
  swift-foundation by 2, 7, 11 and 38 lines. They look like near-pristine swift-foundation files and
  are not; they are 5.4's.
- `Codable.swift` is closer to 5.4 (52 changed lines against 66).
- The swift-foundation files kept here have **no 5.4 counterpart at all**, which is what fixes their lineage.

One file is genuinely undetermined and is flagged rather than assumed: `DateInterval.swift` is
closer to swift-foundation (57 changed lines) than to 5.4 (87), while `README.md` attributes it to
the 5.4 overlay. It is identical to neither, so it is adapted, and this file does not claim to know
from which. Anyone recounting should run the two-way diff rather than a one-way one, and should
expect to reach the same list only if they use the same provenance list.

## The swift-foundation files that are not taken from the checkout

Each is described here, except `Locale+Components.swift` (under the `Locale` entries below) and the
ICU formatting ones (under "ICU-backed format styles").

### Why these are override files rather than patches

The general rule is to carry a divergence in whichever form is smaller, counted as **lines the
repository carries**. That convention matters and belongs next to any such table: a stricter count
on the patch side, dropping diff metadata or a patch's own explanatory header, biases the comparison
by exactly what it strips, while an override file is carried whole including its upstream licence
header and any comment explaining the reduction. `CodableUtilities.swift` is the clean example of
the mirror image: of its 19 lines, 11 are the Apache header and about 4 are the comment saying what
was dropped, so a divergence-only count would score it at about 4 and flatter the override form by
the same mechanism a metadata-stripped count flatters the patch form. Count what lands in the tree,
on both sides.

Per file, that gives a split answer:

| file | patch | file | smaller |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CodableUtilities.swift` | 696 lines | 19 lines | override |
| `String+Comparison.swift` | 775 lines | 21 lines | override |
| `AttributedStringProtocol.swift` | 57 lines | 271 lines | patch |
| `Locale+Components.swift` | 23 lines | 2,086 lines | patch |
| `FoundationAttributes.swift` | 88 lines | 964 lines | patch |

The patch column is raw `diff -u` output; a committed patch file would also carry a short header
saying why it exists, which adds a handful of lines to that side and changes none of the five
directions. All five are kept as override files anyway, so that this overlay has one mechanism rather than two
for a saving of 57 lines on one file. That is a deliberate departure from the rule and is recorded
here rather than left to look like the rule endorsing it. If a patch step is ever added,
`Locale+Components.swift` is the strongest candidate by a factor of ninety, and the patch must be
applied to a copy of the checkout, never to the checkout itself, since `SWIFT_FOUNDATION_SRC` can
point at a shared or read-only tree.

- **`FoundationAttributes.swift`, with `inlinePresentationIntent` moved out of `#if
  FOUNDATION_FRAMEWORK`.** The stored property, `InlinePresentationIntentAttribute` and its
  unavailable `Sendable` extension are compiled; the attribute drops its
  `ObjectiveCConvertibleAttributedStringKey` conformance, which lives in the guarded half of
  `Conversion.swift`. `InlinePresentationIntent` itself is the Clang import of darling-foundation's
  `NSInlinePresentationIntent`, as on macOS; the file adds its `Hashable` and `Codable` conformances
  (Apple documents both; the Clang importer declares neither for an option set), implemented by
  `RawRepresentable`'s defaults.

- **`CodableUtilities.swift`, reduced to two declarations.** Only `EmptyCodingKeys` and
  `DefaultAssociatedValueCodingKeys1` are kept, which is all that `AttributedString`'s
  `CodableWithConfiguration` conformances reference. Taking the file whole was measured and does not
  work: it needs `JSON/`, which needs `Decimal/` and `Base64.swift`, and that stack then collides
  with the 5.4 JSON and property-list code this overlay already ships. The collisions are
  `invalid redeclaration of '_plistNull'`, `invalid redeclaration of '_PlistDecodingStorage'` and
  `'_PlistDecodingStorage' is ambiguous for type lookup`, plus 22 further errors inside
  `PlistEncoder.swift` and 6 inside `JSONEncoder.swift`. Replacing the 5.4 JSON and property-list
  stack with swift-foundation's is a separate piece of work with its own symbol-diff acceptance, not
  a side effect of adding `AttributedString`.

- **`String+Comparison.swift`, reduced to the two UTF-8 code-unit constants.** `StringBlocks.swift`
  needs `UTF8.CodeUnit.newline` and `.carriageReturn`. Taking the file whole was measured: with
  `UnicodeScalar.swift` and `BidirectionalCollection.swift` added it still fails with 80 errors, 72
  of which are the same defect that forces the next entry, `String.CompareOptions` importing as a
  plain raw-value struct instead of an `OptionSet`. The remaining 8 are `BuiltInUnicodeScalarSet`
  (whose file imports the `_FoundationCShims` C target) and `RegexPatternCache`.

- **`AttributedStringProtocol.swift`, with `range(of:options:locale:)` and its `_range` helper
  omitted.** Both declare a `String.CompareOptions = []` default argument, which does not type-check
  for the same reason. The root cause is not `NSString.h`, which declares the type correctly with
  `NS_OPTIONS`; it is `src/external/foundation/include/Foundation/NSObjCRuntime.h`, whose
  `NS_OPTIONS` macro omits the `flag_enum` and `enum_extensibility(open)` attributes that make the
  Clang importer present the type as an `OptionSet`. `CFAvailability.h` in the same project already
  applies both through `__CF_OPTIONS_ATTRIBUTES`, so `CF_OPTIONS` types always imported correctly
  and `NS_OPTIONS` was the lone holdout, across 46 typedefs in 28 headers. It is fixed in
  darling-foundation#38, which needs a darling-swift companion because correcting the import also
  changes how those constants are spelled in Swift. When both land, this entry and the one above
  should be revisited and should disappear. No binary in the macOS 26 app corpus binds either
  omitted symbol.

- **`Locale.Components` is excluded from the build.** In
  `Foundation/Locale+Components.swift` it is kept verbatim but wrapped in `#if
  DARLING_LOCALE_COMPONENTS`, which nothing defines. Two things block it, both in Darling's
  `Calendar` and `TimeZone` rather than in the type itself: its `icuIdentifier` property calls
  `Calendar.Identifier.cldrIdentifier`, `Calendar.Identifier.legacyKeywordKey` and
  `TimeZone.legacyKeywordKey`, and its synthesised `Codable` conformance needs a `Codable`
  `Calendar.Identifier`. This overlay's `Calendar` and `TimeZone` come from the Swift 5.4 Darwin
  overlay, not from swift-foundation, and have none of those but `cldrIdentifier`, which
  `FormattingSupport.swift` supplies for the date styles. `icuIdentifier` is the whole point of
  the type (it is how a `Locale.Components` turns back into a locale identifier), so a copy without
  it would be a public type that cannot do the one job it exists for. Excluding it costs nothing
  against measured demand: no binary in the macOS 26 app corpus binds a `Locale.Components` symbol.
  Everything else in the file, including `Locale.Script`, `Locale.Collation`,
  `Locale.NumberingSystem`, `Locale.Weekday`, `Locale.HourCycle`, `Locale.MeasurementSystem`,
  `Locale.Subdivision`, `Locale.Variant`, `ICULegacyKey` and the ISO language, region and script
  tables, is compiled unmodified.
- **`Foundation/Locale+Darling.swift` is a Darling reimplementation, not upstream code.** It
  supplies the four accessors that reach the vendored types from a `Locale`: `Locale.language`,
  `Locale.region`, `Locale.currency` and `Locale.Language.languageCode`. Upstream implements these
  in `FoundationInternationalization/Locale/Locale+Components_ICU.swift` and the `_Locale` protocol,
  reading components straight out of ICU through `uloc_getLanguage`, `uloc_getCountry` and friends.
  This overlay's `Locale` is the Swift 5.4 SDK overlay's wrapper around `NSLocale`, which has no
  such internals, so the components are read from `NSLocale` instead: `languageCode`, `scriptCode`,
  `regionCode` and `currencyCode`, which Darling's CoreFoundation backs with its own ICU-backed
  `CFLocale`. That is the same data upstream reads, reached through Darling's own locale machinery.
  Two behavioural differences follow, and neither invents a value:
  - `Locale.region` reads `NSLocaleCountryCode`, so an `rg` override in the identifier is honoured
    only as far as Darling's `CFLocale` honours it. Upstream distinguishes `Locale.region` from
    `Locale.language.region` on exactly that key.
  - `Locale.Language.languageCode` returns the stored `components.languageCode` with no fallback.
    Upstream falls back to `uloc_getLanguage(components.identifier)` when the stored code is nil.
    Every `Locale.Language` initializer this overlay ships stores the code directly, so there is no
    identifier left to parse and the stored value is the complete answer; nil means the language
    genuinely has no code.
- **`Locale.numberingSystem`, `Locale.Language(identifier:)`, `Locale.Language.Components(identifier:)`,
  `Locale.Language.characterDirection` and `Locale.Language.maximalIdentifier` are ported from
  upstream** (`Locale+Components_ICU.swift`, `Locale_ICU.swift`) into `Locale+Darling.swift`. They
  make the same ICU calls upstream makes (`unumsys_open`, `uloc_getLanguage`/`Script`/`Country`,
  `uloc_getCharacterOrientation`, `uloc_addLikelySubtags`, `uloc_toLanguageTag`), against Darling's
  own ICU 66 through the `_FoundationICU` module in `shims/overlay-shims.modulemap`, which admits
  only the ICU headers these calls need; `build.sh` links `libicucore`. OpenSwiftUI uses all five.
- **`Locale.Language.script` and `Locale.Language.region` are not provided.** They are the other two
  members of the same upstream ICU file. Nothing in the app corpus binds them, and adding them would
  be more Darling reimplementation for no measured demand.

## ICU-backed format styles

`Date.FormatStyle` (with `Date.FormatStyle.Attributed`, `Date.AttributedStyle` and its
`DiscreteFormatStyle` conformance), `Date.VerbatimFormatStyle`, `Date.ParseStrategy`,
`Date.RelativeFormatStyle` and `Date.AnchoredRelativeFormatStyle` are built from swift-foundation's
`FoundationInternationalization`, over the ICU Darling already ships, and
`Date.ComponentsFormatStyle` is written over the same ICU (below).

- **The fetched files import the same `_FoundationICU` module as the `Locale` accessors above.**
  Upstream's sources `internal import _FoundationICU`, swift-foundation-icu's vendored ICU 74; here
  that name is Darling's ICU 66.1 (`shims/FoundationICU.h`), so they compile unmodified. The headers
  they call into are admitted alongside `uloc.h` and `unumsys.h`. Every call the fetched date files
  make exists in ICU 66, `udat_formatForFields` and `udat_patternCharToDateFormatField` included.
- **Fetched unmodified**: the whole `UPSTREAM_INTL_FILES` list in `build.sh` (the date, number,
  byte-count and duration styles and their ICU plumbing), plus `FoundationEssentials`'
  `Formatting/FormatterCache.swift`, `Formatting/BinaryInteger+NumericStringRepresentation.swift`
  and `String/BidirectionalCollection.swift`. `NumberFormatStyleConfiguration.swift` is fetched
  whole, so it now supplies `FormatStyleCapitalizationContext`, which had been kept separately.
- **Five override files, each a departure from the patch rule** (lines the repository carries,
  counted as above; the patch column is raw `diff -u`):

  | file | patch | file | smaller |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `ICU+Enums.swift` | 27 lines | 253 lines | patch |
  | `ICUPatternGenerator.swift` | 41 lines | 103 lines | patch |
  | `Decimal+FormatStyle.swift` | 20 lines | 456 lines | patch |
  | `Decimal+ParseStrategy.swift` | 29 lines | 151 lines | patch |
  | `Duration+UnitsFormatStyle.swift` | 54 lines | 789 lines | patch |

  All are kept as override files for the one-mechanism reason given for the override files above.
  `ICU+Enums.swift` drops the aliases for `UDAT_NARROW_QUARTERS`, `UDAT_STANDALONE_NARROW_QUARTERS`
  (ICU 70) and `UDateFormatHourCycle` (ICU 67). `ICUPatternGenerator.swift` replaces
  `defaultHourCycle`, which calls `udatpg_getDefaultHourCycle` (ICU 67), with the hour field in the
  pattern skeleton `j` resolves to. CLDR defines `j` as the locale's preferred hour format, which is
  the datum that call reports.
  The two `Decimal` files name the `FoundationEssentials` module in their non-framework branches;
  here they name `Foundation`, the module they build into. `Duration+UnitsFormatStyle.swift`
  stores its width as an internal copy of the `Measurement<UnitDuration>.FormatStyle.UnitWidth`
  value swift-foundation's stub declares, since this overlay has no `Measurement` and the macOS
  `Measurement.FormatStyle` is not open source; and its attributed format finds the `{0}`
  placeholder with `BidirectionalCollection._range(of:anchored:backwards:)`, because
  `AttributedString.range(of:options:)` is omitted here (above).
- **`Decimal` is VibeDarling/darling-swift#63's**, `NSDecimal` imported as `Decimal` through
  darling-foundation#58's API notes. The number styles only need it to spell rounding increments
  and scales in ICU skeletons (percent formatting and `.increment` precision), and at run time
  those need darling-foundation#57's `NSDecimalString`; without it they crash in Darling's
  float-based fallback.
- **`Foundation/FormattingSupport.swift` is written for Darling.** The fetched files reach into
  internals of swift-foundation's own `Locale` and `Calendar`, which this overlay's `NSLocale`- and
  `NSCalendar`-backed types do not have. It supplies them under the same names, copying upstream
  wherever upstream's code does not depend on those internals, and marks each copied piece with its
  source file. The differences in behaviour:
  - `Locale.identifierCapturingPreferences` is the identifier and `forceFirstWeekday` is `nil`:
    Darling's `Locale` carries no per-user preference overrides, so there are none to capture.
  - `Calendar.localeIdentifierWithCalendar` canonicalizes the identifier with `uloc_canonicalize`
    (which folds a BCP 47 `-u-ca-` extension into keywords) and sets the `calendar` keyword with
    `uloc_setKeywordValue`, where upstream round-trips through `Locale.Components`, excluded here.
  - `Calendar.ComponentSet` keeps upstream's bits except `isLeapMonth` and `isRepeatedDay`, which
    nothing uses. This overlay's `Calendar.Component` has no `dayOfYear`, so a day-of-year field
    gets no update schedule; upstream's `UpdateSchedule.reduce` drops it the same way.
  - `Locale.hourCycle` (public, macOS 13) consults an `hours` keyword, then an `rg` region
    override, then the locale's own data, in the order upstream's `Locale_ICU` does. Without `rg`,
    upstream asks for the locale's region and this asks for the locale; ICU resolves `j` by region.
  - `Date.formatted(_:)` and the two `Date(_:strategy:)` initializers are upstream's
    `Date+FormatStyle.swift`, whose non-framework branch names the `FoundationEssentials` module.
  - ICU failures are logged through `os_log`; upstream calls an interpolating `Logger.error` that
    Darling's `os` overlay does not have.
- **`Foundation/Date+ComponentsFormatStyle.swift` is written for Darling.** swift-foundation ships
  only a stub of `Date.ComponentsFormatStyle` off-Darwin (`Date+ComponentsFormatStyle+Stub.swift`,
  whose `Field` is kept verbatim); the macOS implementation is not open source. The rest follows
  the SDK's `Foundation.swiftinterface` and Apple's published documentation
  (<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/date/componentsformatstyle>), over Apple ICU's
  `uameasfmt` measure formatter, which gives the styles their unit names and list patterns:
  `wide`, `abbreviated`, `condensedAbbreviated` and `narrow` are its `WIDE`, `SHORT`, `SHORTER` and
  `NARROW` widths; `spellOut` formats each value with ICU's spell-out rules and joins them with the
  locale's unit list pattern; `timeDuration` is its positional `NUMERIC` width over hours, minutes
  and seconds, leading zero fields dropped and at least two kept. The components come from
  `Calendar.dateComponents(_:from:to:)`, zero values dropped as the documentation says (a zero
  duration shows the smallest field). Where the documentation is silent these are Darling's
  choices, not observed macOS behaviour: `fields == nil` means all seven fields, the default
  `allowedUnits` of `NSDateComponentsFormatter`; `fields == []` formats as an empty string;
  `isPositive == false` formats the negative components as ICU renders them (for `timeDuration`
  ICU falls back from positional to a unit list, since it takes no negative positional values).
  The `DiscreteFormatStyle` bounds are found by stepping the moving end one smallest-field unit
  and bisecting to where the components change, to within a millisecond, the resolution at which
  CFCalendar compares dates; month and year clamping rule out inverting the calendar arithmetic.
  Week counts are always 0 under Darling today, a CoreFoundation bug tracked in
  VibeDarling/darling#858, so with automatic fields ten days read "10 days" rather than a week and
  three days.
- **Known divergence: zero integer digits.** `.precision(.integerLength(0))` (or an integer range
  of `0...0`) asks ICU for the `integer-width/*` skeleton. ICU 66's skeleton parser has no option
  that truncates every integer digit, so such a style falls back to upstream's unformatted
  description of the value, and a `Duration.UnitsFormatStyle` with a value length of 0 traps on
  upstream's force-unwrapped formatter.
- **Known divergence: CLDR data.** ICU 66 carries CLDR 36. Output follows that data, so for example
  en_US puts a plain space before the day period, where CLDR 42 and later use U+202F.

## ISO 8601 format styles

`Date.ISO8601FormatStyle` (`Date.ISO8601Format()`, `.iso8601`, the parse strategy and the
`iso8601`, `iso8601WithTimeZone` and `iso8601Date` regex components) and
`DateComponents.ISO8601FormatStyle` come from swift-foundation's `FoundationEssentials`, which
formats and parses them in Swift without ICU.

- **Fetched unmodified**: `Formatting/Date+ISO8601FormatStyle.swift`,
  `Formatting/FormatParsingUtilities.swift` and the byte-buffer types they parse and format with,
  `JSON/BufferView.swift`, `JSON/BufferViewIndex.swift`, `JSON/BufferViewIterator.swift` and
  `OutputBuffer.swift`. `FormattingSupport.swift` no longer carries its own copy of `parseError`,
  which now comes from `FormatParsingUtilities.swift`.
- **`Foundation/DateComponents+ISO8601FormatStyle.swift` is an override file**, another departure
  from the patch rule (a 12-line `diff -u` against an 821-line file), kept for the one-mechanism
  reason above. Its one change: parsing an ordinal date checks the day against `1..<367`, the
  Gregorian range upstream reads from `maximumRange(of: .dayOfYear)`, because this overlay's
  `Calendar.Component` has no `dayOfYear` case.
- **Day of year.** This overlay's `DateComponents` has no public `dayOfYear` (macOS 15). It gets an
  internal stored one, which the ISO 8601 styles read and write and which takes part in equality;
  `Calendar.date(from:)` resolves it as January 1st plus that many days, keeping the time of day,
  with swift-foundation's precedence (a `day`, or a `weekday` with an ordinal, week of year or week
  of month, wins), and `FormattingSupport.swift`'s `Calendar._dateComponents(_:from:)` fills it
  from `ordinality(of: .day, in: .year, for:)`. So ordinal dates (`.year().day()`) format and parse, but
  a `DateComponents` parsed from one does not show its day of year publicly and loses it when
  bridged to `NSDateComponents` or encoded.
- **`Calendar(identifier: .iso8601)`.** Darling's CoreFoundation has no ISO 8601 calendar, so this
  overlay already fell back to a Gregorian one. That fallback now also takes swift-foundation's ISO
  week rules (first weekday Monday, four days in the first week), which the week-of-year form
  depends on: without them 2021-01-01 formats as `2021-W01-05` instead of `2020-W53-05`. The
  calendar still reports `.gregorian` as its identifier.
- **`FormattingSupport.swift` supplies the other internals the fetched files call**: the raw-value
  `DateComponents` initializer (a plain memberwise one here, since this overlay's fields have no
  `NSDateComponentUndefined` to skip), and `TimeZone.fixedOffsetFromGMT`, the offset of zones named
  `GMT`, `GMT+hhmm` or `GMT-hhmm` and nil for others; those are the fixed-offset zones Darling's
  `NSTimeZone` makes. `TimeZone.gmt` (public since macOS 13) is added to `TimeZone.swift`.

## How the fetched code is built

- **swift-collections is built without library evolution and linked into `libswiftFoundation`.**
  `InternalCollectionsUtilities` and `_RopeModule` are an implementation detail of
  `AttributedString`'s storage, not part of the SDK, so `build.sh` compiles them to objects and
  links those into the Foundation dylib rather than shipping them as dylibs. Apple links
  `CollectionsInternal` into `Foundation.framework` the same way, and hides its symbols, so
  `build.sh` passes ld64 an `-unexported_symbols_list` naming both module prefixes to keep their
  1,159 symbols out of the dylib's export table. Their own sources are unmodified; this is a choice
  about how they are built, not a change to them.

- **`build.sh` passes `-package-name swift-foundation`.** Without it, `package`-level declarations
  such as `LockedState` silently degrade to `fileprivate` and the module does not compile. The value
  matches swift-foundation's own package identity so `package` symbols mangle as upstream does.

## Not built at all, and why

Nothing here is stubbed or approximated. These are left out because no honest source exists in the
tree:

- The `#if FOUNDATION_FRAMEWORK`-guarded parts of the fetched files. The files themselves are
  compiled whole and their unguarded declarations do work, so `AttributeScopes` and
  `FoundationAttributes` exist; what is missing is the guarded half, which is where the attribute
  scope's dynamic registration, `AttributedString`'s `Codable` conformances and
  `AttributedString(NSAttributedString)` live. That mode needs the Clang modules `MachO.dyld`,
  `ReflectionInternal`, `CollectionsInternal` and `Foundation_Private.NSAttributedString`, none of
  which Darling has.
- The ICU-backed `FormatStyle` implementations other than the date, number, byte-count and
  duration styles below (for example `ListFormatStyle` and `Measurement.FormatStyle`), and
  `AttributedString(localized:)`.
- `AttributedString(markdown:)` and `MarkdownParsingOptions`, which need swift-cmark.

## Fixes worth sending upstream
None. Nothing in these two files needed correcting; the only changes are the exclusion above, which
is a statement about Darling's `Calendar` and `TimeZone`, not about swift-foundation.

## Reproducibility

`build.sh` is bit-reproducible when run twice from the same directory: wiping `overlays/build` and
rebuilding produces an identical `libswiftFoundation.dylib`.

It is not reproducible across different build directories. Two builds of the same commit at
different paths give an arm64 slice differing by 26 of 4,110,348 bytes: the 16-byte `LC_UUID`,
which ld64 derives from the content, and five `mov w2, #imm` immediates in `__text` whose values
track the build root's path length exactly (a 41-character root gives 76, an 81-character root 116,
an 83-character root 118). `__swift_modhash` never reaches the dylib; the linker drops it.

This predates the AttributedString work and is not related to whether a dependency is vendored or
fetched. Measured on the tree of #33, which is master plus a CryptoKit framework and contains none
of this branch's changes: built at two different paths, `libswiftFoundation.dylib` differs by 21
bytes and `libswiftDispatch.dylib` by 27, while `Darwin`, `ObjectiveC`, `CoreFoundation`, `os`,
`XPC`, `CoreGraphics`, `AppKit` and `CryptoKit` are all bit-identical.
